            <h1>Masque of the Red Death</h1>
            <h3>by Sara Deck for Fright Rags</h3>
            <p>I had to have this pin when I spied on the <a href="https://www.fright-rags.com/">Fright Rags</a> site a few months ago. Granted, it took me about a second to realize that it was based on Lon Chaney's performance, rather than <a href="https://youtu.be/vCUtm7mCF4I">Roger Corman's film</a>, which starred Vincent Price, Hazel Court (who I always confuse for Carol Ohmart), and it girl Jane Asher. Even though, I have seen the latter multiple times and not once does Vincent Price look like this, but still..</p>
            <p>I quickly rectified my ignorance by checking out the <a href="https://youtu.be/QB5epi_tVcM">Youtube clip</a> of Lon is all his opulence.</p>
            <p>The pin is really lovely. It could only be more grand - and terrifingly tacky - if it were bejeweled in red gemstones.</p>
            <p>I find that with pins I am not at all a fan of high delineation, particularly of faces. Apart from the feathers, which get a little lost due to the size, the lines are effective in the skull - where, in combination with the lighter hue, they make the skull pop. I only wish that the face, hands, and staff head glowed in the dark. But, this is pretty close to perfection.</p>
            <p>It also only has one pin in the back that is not too big, but I wouldn't wear it with a tight knit.</p>
            <p>It is a first pressing, though I saw nothing to indicate it on the card or pin itself. It measures about two inches high and one and a half inches at its widest. The back has an elevated Fright Rags logo.</p>

          <h1>Vincent Price</h1>
          <h3>by Mitch O'Connell for Creepy Co.</h3>
            <p>I gushed when I opened the package and glanced at that beautiful, blue visage. Vincent Price "Phosphorescent Pallor" is even handsomer in person than the site photos had me believe. I thought of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017812/mediaviewer/rm2891394048">Shelby Carpenter</a>, that fragile, selfish, pretty boy that he played in Laura. That furrowed brow is not scaring me.</p>
            <p>The hair and edges have the most attention to line but in a way that is not overwhelming - thanks to the flatness of the pin. Parts of him also <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Hover over Vincent to see him glow!">glow in the dark</a> in a soft, haunting hue - the face and outer edges of his hair, i.e. the white parts.</p>
            <p>He is only slightly bigger than the Lon Chaney pin but feels a lot heavier in hand. A quick turn on its side, and it seems to be at least a third thicker than the latter. The back is stamped with Creepy Co. and features two diagonal pins and rubber stoppers.</p>
            <p>I bought two additional enamel pins from the company, and am super-impressed by the quality and aesthetic of all, even <a href="https://www.creepycompany.com/products/miniature-vampire-teeth-enamel-pin">this simple cutie</a>.</p>
            <p>This measures about two inches by one and half inches. It is a limited edition pin. There is a human-colored version. And, there had been a Dr. Phibes-inspired pink one as well as (this hurts to even type) a <a href="https://twitter.com/creepycompany/status/810940417676050433">Masque of the Red Death (badly sunburnt) version</a>.</p></div>

          <h1>Hello</h1>
          <h3> by Haasbroek for Tee Fury</h3>
            <p>Proof that my pop culture dalliances are not just with the horrific and dead. I bought this, along with another pin, last winter. I had seen the <a href="http://www.teefury.com/hello-627">shirt version</a>, which has the added "Is it me you're looking for" tagline, on a few sites ages before and felt a weak longing for it. (But, I seriously dislike wearing white shirts.)</p>
            <p>It's small - a mere 1.25 by 1 5/16 inches (at its widest). Light, and only has one centrally located pin on the back with a rubber stopper. The back also has the series number.</p>
            <p>TeeFury had a small batch of pins, and seemed to be replenishing those that were sold out with new designs. While they did appear on a limited edition part of their site, I didn't think that they were going to do away with all of them. Hopefully, it's temporary; and, we'll eventually see an <a href="http://www.teefury.com/i-snake-ny">"I Snake NY"</a> pin.</p>

        <h1>Phantom of the Paradise</h1>
        <h3>by Pop-ocalypse from Zazzle</h3>
          <p>I buy a lot of stationary and office-type goods on Zazzle. I will randomly search for a favorite film and come up pretty empty - until this pretty little pin-back button.</p>
          <p>As always, I underestimated the size. I should have gone with the 2 1/4", instead of the 1 1/4", to get the full effect of the still. The black and purple background get lost - especially under my crappy indoor lighting.</p>
          <p>What's there to say? It's unassumingly attractive, lightweight, and properly manufactured. Plus, the thinness of the pin enables someone, who cares about their clothes, to wear them with tighter knits. I wish it would have been offered as other products on the site, though.</p>
          <p>I should add that apart from size options, you can choose between a round or square button.</p>

          <h1>The Morning After</h1>
          <h3>by Paul Southworth for Threadless</h3>
          <p>I bought the Morning After pin for a young family relative. Although not quite Emo or Goth, a vomiting, Bozo-like clown is amusing enough without the usual, tasteless JWG reference.</p>
          <p>The pin seems a little small. It measures about an inch high and 1 1/8" at its widest. Granted, I knew the measurements before buying it, but, in hand, it seemed like one of the many old school pins that you'd find on a musty, tobacco-laden beret. For all obnoxious purposes, I think it should have been about 2" high.</p>
          <p>Apart from that, I have no complaints. It looks exactly like the <a href="https://www.threadless.com/product/282/the_morning_after">illustration</a>. defect-free, and has one small pin in the back - that I still wouldn't wear with a nice sweater.</p>
          <p>It is limited to 100. The enamel is shallow while thick, dark lines are raised around it.</p>
